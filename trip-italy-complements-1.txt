Dear Hélio,
thank you for choosing Domus Gallo.

What time do you expect to arrive on the day?

Domus Gallo is not a Hotel but it is a small family Guesthouse with 3 rooms in Via Cappellini, No 3.

We are a few minutes walk from Termini train station.

FROM TERMINI STATION:
Walk out onto Via Giovanni Giolitti which runs parallel to the station. Turn left on the Via Giovanni Giolitti and walk for about 400 m. Via Cappellini is on your right you will find on the right opposite the underpass from the station. Our B&B Domus Gallo is at no. 3 and please note there are intercoms on both sides of the front door on the street but OURS is on the LEFT SIDE.

I will be there to welcome you.

FROM FIUMICINO AIRPORT:
Take the train to Termini station (Leonardo Express). Trains depart every 30 minutes from 06:00 to 23:30. The ticket price is 15,00 €. Otherwise, take either a taxi for a fixed price of 55,00 € or BusTransfer without intermediate stops (tickets from 4,00 €).

FROM CIAMPINO AIRPORT:
Take either BusTransfer without intermediate stops to Termini station (tickets from € 4,00.) or a taxi for a fixed price of € 40,00.

CHECK IN
The room is ready from 14:00, if you arrive before you can leave your luggage here.

LATE CHECK-IN
The price for late check-in after 10:00 pm is 20.00 euro or you can use self check-in for free.

CHECK-OUT
Check-out is by 11:00, if you leave later you can leave your luggage in the corridor or in the laundry room and bring your room keys with you. Upon your return you can use the laundry bathroom and leave the keys in the black desk in the corridor.

BREAKFAST
The breakfast will not be prepared yet in the kitchen but you will have tickets for the Micky Bar in Via Mamiani 29.
The breakfast is from 6:30 am to 10:30 am and you can choose between Coffee, Cappuccino, Tea, Fresh Croissants, Toast or Orange Juice. Please let us know if you have other preferences.

CLEANING
The room will be cleaned daily from 10:00 am except Sunday which is the cleaner's day off. Towels will be changed for stays longer than 3 days to reduce environmental impact unless otherwise requested by the guest.

METRO
We have 2 Subway Lines:
Line A (Red) for Vatican
Line B (Blue) for the Colosseum [or you can walk there in 15 minutes].
The closest underground station is Vittorio Emanuele Station but it's only Red Line if you need Blue Line you have to go to the Termini Station.

BUS
From Piazza dei Cinquecento in front of Termini Station you can take the “H” Bus for Trastevere.

Tickets are the same for Bus and Subway. The cost is 1.50 euro.

RESTAURANT
I recommend the typical Roman Trattoria and Pizzeria "Vecchia Roma" in Via Ferruccio 12. Closed on Sundays.
Recommended dishes: Amatriciana and Carbonara.

HEATING
Heating is automatic and turn on and off at programmed times. If you want to change them send me a message.

TOURIST TAX
The tourist tax is 7,00 euro per person per night. It is not included in the price of the stay.
It must be paid in cash at Check-in.
[Tourist tax increased since 1 January 2025 from 6,00 to 7,00 euro fo Guesthouse Category 1]

We look forward to hearing from you and wish you pleasant journey and stay in Rome.

Kind regards,
Mario
Domus Gallo
